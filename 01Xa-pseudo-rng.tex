	\item[\texttt{.Random.seed}] is an integer vector, containing the \textbf{random number generator} (RNG) state for random number generation in \texttt{R}.\\ It can be saved and restored, but should not be altered by the user.
	
	\item[\texttt{RNGkind}] is a more friendly interface to query or set the kind of RNG in use.

\item[\texttt{RNGversion}] can be used to set the random generators as they were in an earlier \texttt{R} version (for reproducibility).
	
\item[\texttt{set.seed}] is the recommended way to specify seeds.

	\begin{itemize}
	\item Mersenne Twister(MT) is a pseudorandom number generating algorithm developped by Makoto Matsumoto and Takuji Nishimura (alphabetical order) in 1996/1997. 
	\item An improvement on initialization was given on 2002 Jan. 
\end{itemize}

\frametitle{Mersenne Twister}	
The Mersenne Twister  has the following merits:

\begin{itemize}
\item It is designed with consideration on the flaws of various existing generators.
\item The algorithm is coded into a C-source downloadable below.
\item Far longer period and far higher order of equidistribution than any other implemented generators. (It is proved that the period is $2^19937-1$, and 623-dimensional equidistribution property is assured.)
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item Fast generation. (Although it depends on the system, it is reported that MT is sometimes faster than the standard ANSI-C library in a system with pipeline and cache memory.) (Note added in 2004/3: on 1998, usually MT was much faster than rand(), but the algorithm for rand() has been substituted, and now there are no much difference in speed.)
\item Efficient use of the memory. (The implemented C-code mt19937.c consumes only 624 words of working area.)
